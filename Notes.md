### The 4 stages of a bot's life
1. Train
    - Teach the bot what it needs to understand).
    - Create **intents** (ideas) by using **expressions** (words that the bot should recognize coming from the user)
2. Build
   - Use Bot Builder to create conversational flow.
   - Create skills (things you want your bot to do) and decide when they will be triggered.
   - Your skills are defined by **triggers**, **requirements** (info that your bot must collect from users), and **actions**.
3. Connect
   - Ship your bot to one or several messaging platforms
4. Monitor
   - See how users are communicating with your bot
   - Check to see if the bot understands the users correctly
   - Make updates to the bots intents/ entities.
   - Monitor is important as it lets me see what the users want, and I can add more capbabilities to the bot.
